This repo contains plugins I have developed / am developing / or have abandoned but want to share the knowledge with the community. 

None of these plugins should be considered production ready, unless you have looked at the code, understand it, and have run it for a little time.

Most of these plugins are largely untested and may contain bugs, if you happen to find and fix a couple, sure feel free to submit a pull request.

Cheers,
